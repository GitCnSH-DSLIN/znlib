PLEASE NOTE THAT THE LICENSE AGREEMENT HAS CHANGED!!! 26. Oct. 2011

LICENSE AGREEMENT
-----------------
Before using or evaluating kbmMemTable/kbmSQL you are required to read this license agreement in full,
and agree to its full contents. By starting to use or evaluate kbmMemTable/kbmSQL you have automatically
agreed on the full contents of this license.

All files part of the package, except the files
CocoAncestor.pas, COPYING.txt, COPYING-LIB.txt, LICENSE-2.0.txt and NOTICE.txt
are the property of Kim Bo Madsen, Components4Developers and ideas and conceptuals coming from them
may not be copied in part or in full.
The file CocoAncestor.pas that is included in this package, is covered by one of the licenses 
GPL, LGPL or Apache License 2.0. Components4Developers have chosen to adhere to the Apache License 2.0 for
the file CocoAncestor.pas.
Check the folder (externallicenses) for the Apache License.
All files (except CocoAncestor.pas and the text files in externallicenses) 
are covered by the kbmMemTable/kbmSQL license described in this document.

To use the files within this product, you must have a developer license.

Developer licenses fall in 4 categories:

1) Application specific freeware license. An application specific
   freeware license can be obtained for strictly freeware noncommercial
   applications, and in some situations for commercial charity purposes, but
   only after _written_ agreement with Components4Developers.
   Components4Developers retain the full right to decide if a specific
   project/application require a commerical license or not.

   A freeware license is restricted to a specific application/project and
   to one specific developer only, unless other agreement has been made in
   writing with Components4Developers.

2) Commercial licenses. Commercial licenses _must_ be obtained to use
   these components or any part of kbmMemTable/kbmSQL.

   Unless you have gotten a _written_ agreement with Components4Developers
   about a freeware license, you _must_ purchase one or more commercial licenses.

   A commercial licence is restricted to one and only one specific developer.
   Thus if more or other developers use kbmMemTable/kbmSQL, additional developer
   licenses must be obtained.

3) Free commercial licenses.
   A free commercial license means that kbmMemTable/kbmSQL can be used for free in 
   non open source applications regardless if they are for commercial use or not,
   provided that the applications do not compete against any C4D products at any time,
   and that a notification is sent to sales@components4developers.com about what the
   license is used for. 
   Components4Developers retain the right to use the name of the 
   companies/entities using the free commercial license for PR/reference purposes.
   Free commercial licenses are only valid when they have been issued by
   Components4Developers in writing for a specific project.

4) Free "CodeGear" licences.
   A free "CodeGear" license means that kbmMemTable/kbmSQL or both were made available
   for developers as a CodeGear Edition. The CodeGear Edition do not contain source for kbmMemTable/kbmSQL.
   It is allowed to produce compiled end user products (commercial and non commercial) not competing with 
   Components4Developers products, for free and without runtime license requirements for the products that
   are part of the CodeGear Edition package.
   Components4Developers retain the right to use the name of the 
   companies/entities using the free "CodeGear" license for PR/reference purposes.

A license is only valid for the specific SKU (eg. Standard Edition, Professional Edition, CodeGear Edition)
for which the license originally was obtained. Its not legal to 'borrow' parts
from other licensed SKU levels's to enhance a licensed SKU.

You are not allowed to create developer libraries based on these components
regardless of license choise without prior _written_ agreement with Components4Developers.

You are not allowed to copy source code in parts or full into other
libraries or applications or to distribute source in part or in full.

You are not allowed to copy binary library code in parts or full to other developers.
Other developers must obtain their own license from Components4Developers.

You are not allowed to create competing products using ideas or source from
the components/files which are part of kbmMemTable/kbmSQL or any knowledge gained from
using/browsing the files/components which are part of the kbmMemTable/kbmSQL package.

You are not allowed to discuss in public the algorithms used within the kbmMemTable/kbmSQL
products/files.

Copies of the kbmMemTable and/or kbmSQL package, not obtained _directly_ from Components4Developers
are illegal and therefore not permitted. kbmMemTable and/or kbmSQL must _not_ be
distributed via any 3rdparty channels, except via Components4Developers.

No part of the kbmMemTable and/or kbmSQL package may be published in parts or in full unless
a specific permit is granted by Components4Developers.

When, and only when, a valid commercial or freeware license has been obtained,
you are free to distribute your compiled and linked application without
royalty requirements for kbmMemTable/kbmSQL. Freeware licenses can contain restrictions to
the number of royalty free copies that can be distributed, unless
specifically agreed in writing with Components4Developers.

At the time of receiving the license for kbmMemTable/kbmSQL, a specified length of Service and Update 
subscription is included with the license. While the subscription is active,
new updates can be fetched, after registration and requesting the license, from the
Components4Developers portal (https://portal.components4developers.com).
The moment the subscription runs out, the right to newer free updates is automatically revoked.
Additional periods of SAU can be purchased from Components4Developers.
Extensions for SAU are always calculated from the end date of the previous SAU period.

The kbmMemTable/kbmSQL package and files can never be subject to any GPL or LGPL or similar license 
except where specifically stated in this license agreement.
Thus regardless of if you use this library in combination with GPL'ed or LGPL'ed or similar 
licensed code, the kbmMemTable/kbmSQL package including all its files, unless Components4Developers has 
specifically stated otherwise for specific files, remain being subject _only_ to the license
stated in this document.
Any 3rdparty licenses, regardless if they are viral or not, cannot overrule this license.
In case kbmMemTable/kbmSQL is used in an application in combination with libraries which are subject
to the GPL/LGPL or other viral license the developer/publisher is required to include a text 
file specifically stating that kbmMemTable/kbmSQL and all parts theirof are not subject to the 
GPL/LGPL or similar viral license. Further no parts of kbmMemTable/kbmSQL sourcecode may be 
published or included unless specifically prior written agreement with Components4Developers.

If you find bugs (and optionally fix them) or alter the components, you must make
that change/fix/report available to Components4Developers.
Not doing so violates any obtained license.

License violations, may void your licenses. This is determined case by case
solely by Components4Developers.

Obtaining a license by fraud, or other improper action or by giving misleading
information will automatically void your license.

Using kbmMemTable/kbmSQL for illegal purposes automatically voids your license.

If a license becomes void, all licenses from Components4Developers for that 
specific entity (company/individual) are automatically void.

When a license becomes void, you are _required_ to remove _ALL_ copies of 
the licenced product including all compiled and noncompiled files. 
You also MUST remove the previously licenced product from your applications immediately.

Expiration of a SAU (Service and Update) subscription do not in it self void your license(s).

Any ruling by Components4Developers to void a license is final
and cannot be appealed to courts or other authorities.
